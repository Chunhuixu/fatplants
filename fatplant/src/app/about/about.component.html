        <p class="amber-text text-darken-2"> Increasing seed oil content by plant breeding has resulted in trade-offs or penalties with respect to protein content, seed size, or seed set. The molecular basis for this impasse is mostly speculative. Use of current global profiling approaches to better understand both the metabolic consequences of higher oil and the basis for reduced yield must also deal with off-target genetic mutations (even in near-isogenic lines), ultimately confounding cause-effect interpretations. We propose a diverse, integrated strategy to study the consequences of higher lipid production by studying transgenic plants specifically engineered to produce higher seed oil. Breakthroughs on the regulation of the committed step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS) have been leveraged to produce oilseeds with substantially higher oil content. Prior to this time, changes in oil content have been minor which has made identification of small differences in metabolism difficult to study. We are now in a position to address recalcitrant questions about the metabolic consequences for enhancing seed oil.</p>

        <h1><span>Project aims</span></h1>

        <p><span class = "amber-text">Aim1: Establish regulatory features in oil-for-protein or oil-for-seed yield tradeoffs by measuring: transcripts, polysomal loading (i.e. dynamically translated transcript levels), proteins and metabolites during three stages of seed development in the engineered high-oil lines compared to wild type (WT).</span></p>
        <p><span class = "amber-text">Aim2: Measure the oil-protein tradeoff through analysis of carbon flux into central and fatty acid metabolism in high-oil versus WT germplasm.</span></p>
        <p><span class = "amber-text">Aim3: Assess acyl-lipid biosynthetic/turnover rates, and bottlenecks within the lipid metabolic network through targeted flux analysis.</span></p>
        <p><span class = "amber-text">Aim4: Develop a “one-stop-shop” community web resource for all data pertaining to enhancing oil content in plants to leverage data generated from this project with curated forms of public data other funded web sites, and the literature.</span></p>
        <p><span class = "amber-text">Aim5: Improve STEM education by providing multidisciplinary training to college students, graduates, postgraduates, and high school teachers.</span></p>
