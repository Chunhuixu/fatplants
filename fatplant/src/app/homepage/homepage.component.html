      <mat-card-content class="primary main-content">Increasing seed oil content by plant breeding has resulted in trade-offs or penalties with
          respect to protein content, seed size, or seed set. The molecular basis for this impasse is
          mostly speculative. Use of current global profiling approaches to better understand both the
          metabolic consequences of higher oil and the basis for reduced yield must also deal with off-target
          genetic mutations (even in near-isogenic lines), ultimately confounding cause-effect interpretations.
          We propose a diverse, integrated strategy to study the consequences of higher lipid production by studying
          transgenic plants specifically engineered to produce higher seed oil.<br /><br />
          Breakthroughs on the regulation of the committed step of de novo fatty acid synthesis (FAS) have been leveraged to produce oilseeds with
          substantially higher oil content. Prior to this time, changes in oil content have been minor which
          has made identification of small differences in metabolism difficult to study. We are now in a
          position to address recalcitrant questions about the metabolic consequences for enhancing seed oil.
